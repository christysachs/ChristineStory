There once was a boy named Quinn. He had a really bad nut allergy, but he didn't want to tell any of his friends. He went to get dinner with them and enjoy their company, but when it came time for dessert, he noticed there was a pecan pie lying in his wake. "Would you like some pie?" One of them asked, but he just stood there and pretended to be full. 
  
Than he contemplated on whether he should eat the pie and suffer or refuse a 
perfectly good baked pie that is supposelly the most delicious pie known to 
mankind. Now you see his delimma. His friends than offer him the whole pie
after Quinn's stomach started to growl.
